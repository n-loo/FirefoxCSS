My Firefox css mods
The base theme is from https://github.com/migueravila/SimplerentFox with some mods I added to it. 

You can change the wallpaper if you want for the new tab by changing the .jpg. 

To add this to your Firefox:
- First enable custom CSS on Firefox
- Take the `./chrome` folder on this repo and put it in your profile folder (something like `c/USER/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/[xxxxx].default-release/)`
